Data-driven urban planning report using a mock census dataset to guide investment and land development for a commuter town. Analyses demographics, commuting, and socioeconomic trends to recommend sustainable growth strategies.


Effective planning and policymaking have long relied heavily on census data, which gives governments the information they need to build infrastructure, distribute resources, and shape communities. Based on the foundation of census analysis, this report addresses particular investment and development issues encountered by a small town located between two major cities using a mock dataset. Despite being fictional, the dataset provides a useful framework for decision-making by simulating real-world demographic and socioeconomic trends. The town is characterised by its status as a hub for commuters, its lack of a university, and its reliance on links to neighbouring cities. For the local government, this context offers both challenges and opportunities. This report's main goals are to first, to determine the most appropriate development for an unoccupied plot of land, and second, to prioritize investment areas that will yield the most significant benefit to the townâ€™s residents. These decisions need to be supported by thorough data analysis and weighed against conflicting population demands. This paper conducts a thorough examination of age distribution, commuting patterns, religious demographics, healthcare demands, and other socioeconomic variables in order to accomplish these goals. The results are utilised to create practical suggestions that support the town's long-term development and sustainability objectives. This research emphasises the wider significance of making well-informed decisions in urban planning by utilising data science methodologies, in addition to offering a data-driven development strategy.
